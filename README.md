## Ironhack Project #2
From March to June 2018 I attended a **Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp** in Paris with [Ironhack](http://www.ironhack.com/en).

The program was very dense yet well structured and I learnt the following tech stack & tools:
- Angular 5
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express.js
- Javascript & Typescript
- HTML 5 / CSS 3
- GitHub
- Bash CLI

GiftHub is the second of three projects I did during the bootcamp. It was created with my fellow Ironhacker @mbbaber, hope you enjoy it!

### [>>Here's the game!](https://lucasm-git.github.io/duri-the-dwarf/)


## Context
The 1st project happened after two weeks of learning. At this point, we had covered:
- basic HTML & CSS manipulation
- some JS and jQuery, including arrays, objects, events and DOM manipulation

The insctructions were to create a browser-based game using a combination of technologies among the ones we studied so far.

## What is the game about?
As every dwarf, Duri likes caves, tunnels, gems and treasures. It so happens he smelt the presence of a big crystal in a nearby cave, at the center of which he starts when you launch the game. With the help of his pickaxe, Duri has to dig through the cave, looking for the crystal.

But beware, he can't exist the game board, nor can he dig through rock. Also, he has a limited vision and number of movements, so move carefully and wish for luck!

## How does the tech work under the hood?
The game board is a dynamically generated 2D array of tiles that refreshes upon each user action. Vision, rocks, visited tiles and player sprite are CSS classes applied to each tile after every move, depending on the player position on the grid.

## Summary
This was the very first game I ever developed, I had so much fun creating it and will probably continue working on it after the bootcamp.

Hope you enjoyed playing it, and don't hesitate to give me any (constructive) feedback!
